# Premiere Pro C++ SDK

We have updated the Premiere Pro C++ SDK for version 26.0.

We've included our SDK and API documentation as a PDF; we regularly update the documentation, here:

[https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev)

## What's new in 26.0

### WinARM support

There have been relatively few substantive changes to the APIs available to plugins, the SDK example projects have been updated to include WinARM native projects. 

### Updated shared headers

For some time, the "shared" headers distributed within the SDK have been decoupled from those used in our actual application development. No more; the headers have been unified. NOTE: The headers may contain structures, selectors and APIs we have not yet documented; we're working on it.

**Note**: The GPU examples require further attention, and have been temporarily removed from the SDK; we'll add them back in a subsequent release.


## Let us know what you need

Feel free to ask questions and share issues on the Premiere Pro SDK Forum! Our team staffs the forum, and are happy to help.
